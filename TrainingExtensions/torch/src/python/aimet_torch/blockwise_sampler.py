    Class providing blockwise sampling utilities. Specifically, BlockWise sampler allows users to specify a list of
    sequential blocks in the module, and the sampler will yield each block, along with the FP and QT inputs to that
    block as a part of the sample() loop.
    BlockwiseSampler caches each block input and resumes computation from that point when the user returns control to
    the sampling loop. This way, excess computational costs for large models is avoided, and the loop is able to make
    use of any user adjustments to quantization parameters for a particular block made in the sampling loop.
    NOTE: users CAN NOT modify model weights during the sample() loop
